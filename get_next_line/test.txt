This is the first line.
Here's the second line.
Line three has some numbers: 12345
Fourth line with special characters: !@#$%
This is the fifth line, almost done.

Finally, the sixth line concludes the text.
This is a short line.

Here is a line with special characters: @#$%^&*()_+{}

This line is quite long and stretches far beyond what most would expect, which makes it perfect for testing buffer overflows and ensuring that your get_next_line function handles longer text correctly without truncating or mishandling data.

Short.
Another one.

End of file test.
